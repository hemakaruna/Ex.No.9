## **Aim**
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-video generation tools to create a high-definition open-heart surgery tutorial by crafting precise, medically accurate prompts. The goal is to identify key procedural, anatomical, and instrumental elements within a surgical environment and generate an educational simulation suitable for university-level medical training.

## **Procedure**

### **1. Analyze the Reference Video / Scenario**
Before generating the video, the surgical procedure was analyzed to identify critical visual, anatomical, and procedural elements necessary for educational clarity.

**Key Components Identified:**
- **Anatomical Structures:** Heart chambers, valves (mitral, tricuspid, aortic, pulmonary), coronary arteries, and pericardium.  
- **Surgical Instruments:** Scalpel, retractor, suction tip, forceps, suture needle, and cardiopulmonary bypass machine.  
- **Procedural Steps:**
  1. Patient preparation and sterile draping.  
  2. Median sternotomy (chest opening).  
  3. Exposure of the heart.  
  4. Connection to heart-lung machine.  
  5. Surgical intervention (valve repair/replacement or bypass graft).  
  6. Suturing and closure.  
- **Lighting:** Bright, focused surgical illumination for clarity.  
- **Environment:** Modern, sterile operating room with blue drapes, monitors, and surgical team in protective gear.  
- **Camera Style:** Slow pan and zoom for procedural focus and clarity.

### **2. Create the Basic Prompt**
**Initial Description:**

 ‚ÄúA high-definition educational video showing an open-heart surgery in a sterile operating theatre.‚Äù

---

### **3. Refine the Prompt with More Detail**
**Refined Version:**

 ‚ÄúA detailed high-definition medical tutorial video of an open-heart surgery performed in a sterile operation room ‚Äî showing a surgical team executing a median sternotomy, exposing the heart, connecting the patient to the bypass machine, and performing cardiac repair. Clear labeling of heart structures and precise use of surgical instruments under bright clinical lighting.‚Äù

---

### **4. Identify Style and Educational Influences**
- **Style:** Realistic, sterile, and clinically accurate (medical simulation format).  
- **Tone:** Precise, calm, and didactic ‚Äî ideal for university medical instruction.  
- **Mood:** Professional and focused.  
- **Influence:** Based on real-world cardiac surgery training videos and simulation-based teaching models.

### **5. Adjust and Fine-tune**
**Final Refined Prompt:**

 ‚ÄúA high-definition, clinically accurate open-heart surgery tutorial for medical students ‚Äî showing labeled heart anatomy (atria, ventricles, valves, coronary arteries), surgical instruments (scalpel, retractor, suction tip, forceps), and a step-by-step procedural demonstration from incision to closure. The scene is set in a sterile surgical environment with clear lighting, calm narration tone, and smooth camera movements for instructional clarity.‚Äù

### **6. Generate the Video**
The refined prompt was used with **Hailuo AI**, an advanced text-to-video generation tool, to produce a high-definition educational simulation.  
The resulting video emphasized **anatomical accuracy**, **procedural sequencing**, and **instrumental precision**, avoiding any realistic blood depiction for ethical and educational purposes.
